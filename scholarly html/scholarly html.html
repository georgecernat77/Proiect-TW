            <h3> 2.1 Product Perspective </h3>
            <p>
                The final product is a zoo website, more precisely a web application (open-source) that works independently and is intended for general use. Being an open-source application, it is supposed to be used by an unlimited number of users, including a logging system, which brings a series of extra functionalities. The major components of the application are two: FRONTEND and BACKEND.
                The FRONT part (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) connects with the user, through it he can see and interact with the WEB server, thus benefiting from all the functionalities of the application.
                The BACK part (Xampp,Php,Python) ensures the correctness of the functionalities, being the actual implementation area. Of course, a MySQL database is used as a way to store the data included in the product component

        <section id="chapter2_2">
            <h3> 2.2 Product Functions </h3>
            <p>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This application offers the user a series of functionalities:
                <ul type="square" id="unord">
                    <li> Register </li>
                    <li> Autentification </li>
                    <li> Deconnect </li>
                    <li> Change Password</li>
                    <li> Add Animals </li>
                    <li> Remove animals </li>
                    <li> Account validation </li>
                    <li> Create / Cancel appointments</li>
                    <li> Searching for an animal by filters </li>
                    <li> User Session </li>
                   
                </ul>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It should be mentioned that all these functionalities are only available for users registered and logged into the application.

            <h3> 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics </h3>
            <p>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Zoo Connect application is intended for all web application users. Due to the functionalities it has, it is especially addressed to users who want to find out information about different categories of animals. It is considered that the user has the basic knowledge of internet operation and access to a device connected to the network.

            <h3> 2.4 Operating Environment </h3>
            <p>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Being a web application, Zoo Connect can be accessed from all operating systems (Windows, Linux and MacOS) respectively from any type of browser. These operating environments consist of a user interface generally provided by an application manager, respectively an application programming interface (API) provided by the application manager. The application works on any device/PC with standard specifications, even minimal ones, depending on the speed of the processor, RAM, ROM. The device must be connected to the Internet
            </p>

        <section id="chapter2_5">
            <h3> 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints </h3>
            <p>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Regarding the design elements, a UI/UX Design will be used that will facilitate easy use by all people interested in the site. It is the duty of the developers to comply with some established specifications
                by common agreement regarding the color palette, font size, image sizes, spacing.
                <br>The chosen color palette : <img src="../images/PaletaCulori.png" alt="Paleta Culori" width="800" height="300" alt="Image not found"> 
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Also, there are constraints on the Backend side: each
                team member must write code in the initially established languages.
                <br> Another technical constraint for the good collaboration of the developer team is the regular update (push) on git of any type of information, be they implementations and not only. Working in parallel on the same product is possible
                be quite demanding and it is recommended to pay more attention to the merging of individually worked code parts.

            <h3> 2.6 User Documentation </h3>
            <p>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The application falls into the category of web applications, and its use will be intuitive, more precisely suggested by the entire interface that facilitates the user's navigation in the application and the discovery of useful commands.

        <section id="chapter2_7">
            <h3> 2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies </h3>
            <p>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If the user loses the connection to the Internet, then inevitably the web application will stop responding and its functionalities will become unavailable.
                <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SOFTWARE Dependency: If the application developers do not pay the necessary attention to the written code, especially when they use APIs, it threatens the performance and security of the application.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;
