   "description": [
      "funnel-web spider,  (family Dipluridae),  member of a family of spiders in the order Araneida that are named for their funnel-shaped webs. Their webs open wide at the mouth of the tube, and the spider sits in the narrow funnel waiting for prey to contact the web. When this happens, the spider rushes out and captures the insect prey at the funnel\u2019s mouth. The most important genera are Euagrus, Brachythele, and Microhexura in North America, Trechona in South America, and the venomous members of the Atrax genus in Australia.",
      "The species Atrax robustus and A. formidabilis are large brown bulky spiders that are much feared in southern and eastern Australia because of their venomous bites. Several human deaths from the bites of these aggressive spiders have been recorded in the Sydney area since the 1920s. An antidote to the main toxin in their venom has been developed and is effective if administered to victims soon after they have been bitten."
