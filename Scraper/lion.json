        "lion,  (Panthera leo),  large, powerfully built cat (family Felidae) that is second in size only to the tiger. The proverbial \u201cking of beasts,\u201d the lion has been one of the best-known wild animals since earliest times. Lions are most active at night and live in a variety of habitats but prefer grassland, savanna, dense scrub, and open woodland. Historically, they ranged across much of Europe, Asia, and Africa, but now they are found mainly in parts of Africa south of the Sahara. An isolated population of about 650 Asiatic lions constitute a slightly smaller race that lives under strict protection in India\u2019s Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary.",
        "The lion is a well-muscled cat with a long body, large head, and short legs. Size and appearance vary considerably between the sexes. The male\u2019s outstanding characteristic is his mane, which varies between different individuals and populations. It may be entirely lacking; it may fringe the face; or it may be full and shaggy, covering the back of the head, neck, and shoulders and continuing onto the throat and chest to join a fringe along the belly. In some lions the mane and fringe are very dark, almost black, giving the cat a majestic appearance. Manes make males look larger and may serve to intimidate rivals or impress prospective mates. A full-grown male is about 1.8\u20132.1 metres (6\u20137 feet) long, excluding the 1-metre tail; he stands about 1.2 metres high at the shoulder and weighs 170\u2013230 kg (370\u2013500 pounds). The female, or lioness, is smaller, with a body length of 1.5 metres, a shoulder height of 0.9\u20131.1 metres, and a weight of 120\u2013180 kg. The lion\u2019s coat is short and varies in colour from buff yellow, orange-brown, or silvery gray to dark brown, with a tuft on the tail tip that is usually darker than the rest of the coat.",
        "Lions are unique among cats in that they live in a group, or pride. The members of a pride typically spend the day in several scattered groups that may unite to hunt or share a meal. A pride consists of several generations of lionesses, some of which are related, a smaller number of breeding males, and their cubs. The group may consist of as few as 4 or as many as 37 members, but about 15 is the average size. Each pride has a well-defined territory consisting of a core area that is strictly defended against intruding lions and a fringe area where some overlap is tolerated. Where prey is abundant, a territory area may be as small as 20 square km (8 square miles), but if game is sparse, it may cover up to 400 square km. Some prides have been known to use the same territory for decades, passing the area on between females. Lions proclaim their territory by roaring and by scent marking. Their distinctive roar is generally delivered in the evening before a night\u2019s hunting and again before getting up at dawn. Males also proclaim their presence by urinating on bushes, trees, or simply on the ground, leaving a pungent scent behind. Defecation and rubbing against bushes leave different scent markings."

    "longevity": [
        "In the wild, lions usually live no more than 8 to 10 years because of attacks by humans or other lions, or the effects of goring or kicks from intended prey. In captivity, they may live over 25 years."
